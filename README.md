## 🚀 Portfolio Projects

### FrostOptima - Retail Freezer Profit Optimization
**Problem:** Grocery stores lose significant revenue by placing low-margin products in premium freezer endcap positions, while high-margin items sit in less visible locations.

**Solution:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes product data (cost, margin, sales velocity) and generates optimal endcap configurations that maximize profitability while maintaining product diversity and customer appeal.

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Google AI Studio

**Status:** Live and functional

### PaycheckGPS - Wage Gap Calculator

**Problem:** Workers lack visibility into how inflation and market competition erode their purchasing power, making wage negotiations feel like guesswork.

**Solution:** A data-driven calculator that compares current wages against inflation-adjusted benchmarks and real market rates, showing the exact annual financial impact of wage gaps.

**Tech Stack:** Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, BLS labor market data

**Status:** Live and functional
